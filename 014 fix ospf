On R1, you should configure OSPF process ID 1. Configure the router ID to 1.1.1.1. Include 
all the networks that are associated with each of the three active interfaces for R1 in Area 0.

R1# show ip ospf interface brief
R1#show ip protocols

On R1, enter the following commands:

R1# configure terminal
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)# router-id 1.1.1.1
R1(config-router)# network 10.0.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
R1(config-router)# network 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
R1(config-router)# network 10.10.11.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
R1(config-router)# end

During configuration, a syslog message indicates that new adjacencies have been initiated 
with two neighbors, R2 and R3. The OSPF neighbor state is “FULL”, which means that they have 
synchronized to each other and share the same LSDB knowledge. Note that R2 and R3 are 
represented by the preconfigured router IDs, 2.2.2.2 and 3.3.3.3, respectively.
